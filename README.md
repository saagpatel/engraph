engraph turns your markdown vault into a searchable knowledge graph that any AI agent can query — Claude Code via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), ChatGPT via [Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions), or any tool via REST API. It combines semantic embeddings, full-text search, wikilink graph traversal, temporal awareness, and LLM-powered reranking into a single local binary. Same model stack as [qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd). No API keys, no cloud — everything runs on your machine.

## Why engraph?

Plain vector search treats your notes as isolated documents. But knowledge isn't flat — your notes link to each other, share tags, reference the same people and projects. engraph understands these connections.

- **5-lane hybrid search** — semantic embeddings + BM25 full-text + graph expansion + cross-encoder reranking + temporal scoring, fused via [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf). An LLM orchestrator classifies queries and adapts lane weights per intent. Time-aware queries like "what happened last week" or "March 2026 notes" activate the temporal lane automatically.
- **MCP server for AI agents** — `engraph serve` exposes 25 tools (search, read, section-level editing, frontmatter mutations, vault health, context bundles, note creation, PARA migration, identity) that Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client can call directly.
- **HTTP REST API** — `engraph serve --http` adds an axum-based HTTP server alongside MCP with 26 REST endpoints, API key authentication, rate limiting, and CORS. Web-based agents and scripts can query your vault with simple `curl` calls.
- **Section-level editing** — AI agents can read, replace, prepend, or append to specific sections by heading. Full note rewriting with frontmatter preservation. Granular frontmatter mutations (set/remove fields, add/remove tags and aliases).
- **Vault health diagnostics** — detect orphan notes, broken wikilinks, stale content, and tag hygiene issues. Available as MCP tool and CLI command.
- **Obsidian CLI integration** — auto-detects running Obsidian and delegates compatible operations. Circuit breaker (Closed/Degraded/Open) ensures graceful fallback.
- **Real-time sync** — file watcher keeps the index fresh as you edit in Obsidian. No manual re-indexing needed.
- **Smart write pipeline** — AI agents can create, edit, rewrite, and delete notes with automatic tag resolution, wikilink discovery, and folder placement based on semantic similarity.
- **Fully local** — [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) inference with GGUF models (~300MB mandatory, ~1.3GB optional for intelligence). Metal GPU-accelerated on macOS (88 files indexed in 70s). No API keys, no cloud.

## What problem it solves

You have hundreds of markdown notes. You want your AI coding assistant to understand what you've written — not just search keywords, but follow the connections between notes, understand context, and write new notes that fit your vault's structure.

Existing options are either cloud-dependent (Notion AI, Mem), limited to keyword search (Obsidian's built-in), or require you to copy-paste context manually. engraph gives AI agents direct, structured access to your entire vault through a standard protocol.

## How it works

  Claude / Cursor / any MCP client / curl / web agents
```

1. **Index** — walks your vault, chunks markdown by headings, embeds with a local GGUF model via llama.cpp (Metal GPU on macOS), stores everything in SQLite with FTS5 + sqlite-vec + a wikilink graph
2. **Search** — an orchestrator classifies the query and sets lane weights, then runs up to five lanes (semantic KNN, BM25 keyword, graph expansion, cross-encoder reranking, temporal scoring), fused via RRF
3. **Serve** — starts an MCP server that AI agents connect to, with a file watcher that re-indexes changes in real time

## Quick start

**Install:**

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install devwhodevs/tap/engraph

# Pre-built binaries (macOS arm64, Linux x86_64)
# → https://github.com/devwhodevs/engraph/releases

# From source (requires CMake for llama.cpp)
cargo install --git https://github.com/devwhodevs/engraph
```

**Index your vault:**

```bash
engraph index ~/path/to/vault
# Downloads embedding model on first run (~300MB)
# Incremental — only re-embeds changed files on subsequent runs
```

**Search:**

```bash
engraph search "how does the auth system work"
```

```
 1. [97%] 02-Areas/Development/Auth-Architecture.md > # Auth Architecture  #6e1b70
    OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for all client types. Session tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies...

 2. [95%] 01-Projects/API-Design.md > # API Design  #e3e350
    All endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Tokens are issued by the OAuth 2.0...

 3. [91%] 03-Resources/People/Sarah-Chen.md > # Sarah Chen  #4adb39
    Senior Backend Engineer. Tech lead for authentication and security systems...
```

Note how result #3 was found via **graph expansion** — Sarah's note doesn't mention "auth system" directly, but she's linked from the auth architecture doc via `[[Sarah Chen]]`.

**Claude Code** — Install the plugin (recommended):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add devwhodevs/engraph
claude plugin install engraph@engraph
```

**Connect to Claude Code:**

Or configure MCP manually in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "engraph": {
      "command": "engraph",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now Claude can search your vault, read notes, build context bundles, and create new notes — all through structured tool calls.

**AI Agent Skills** — Install the Engraph skills using the skills CLI (recommended):

```bash
npx skills add devwhodevs/engraph
```

**Enable HTTP REST API:**

```bash
# Start MCP + HTTP server on port 3000
engraph serve --http

# Custom port and host
engraph serve --http --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0

# Local development without API keys (127.0.0.1 only)
engraph serve --http --no-auth
```

**API key management:**

```bash
# Add a new API key (read or write permission)
engraph configure --add-api-key

# List existing keys
engraph configure --list-api-keys

# Revoke a key
engraph configure --revoke-api-key eg_abc123...
```

**Enable intelligence (optional, ~1.3GB download):**

```bash
engraph configure --enable-intelligence
# Downloads Qwen3-0.6B (orchestrator) + Qwen3-Reranker (cross-encoder)
# Adds LLM query expansion + 4th reranker lane to search
```

## Example usage

**4-lane search with intent classification:**

```bash
engraph search "how does authentication work" --explain
```
```
 1. [97%] 01-Projects/API-Design.md > # API Design  #e3e350
    All endpoints require Bearer token authentication...

Intent: Conceptual

--- Explain ---
01-Projects/API-Design.md
  RRF: 0.0387
    semantic: rank #2, raw 0.38, +0.0194
    rerank: rank #2, raw 0.01, +0.0194
02-Areas/Development/Auth-Architecture.md
  RRF: 0.0384
    semantic: rank #1, raw 0.51, +0.0197
    rerank: rank #4, raw 0.00, +0.0187
```

The orchestrator classified the query as **Conceptual** (boosting semantic lane weight). The reranker scored each result for relevance as the 4th RRF lane.

**Rich context for AI agents:**

```bash
engraph context topic "authentication" --budget 8000
```

Returns a token-budgeted context bundle: relevant notes, connected people, related projects — ready to paste into a prompt or serve via MCP.

**Person context:**

```bash
engraph context who "Sarah Chen"
```

Returns Sarah's note, all mentions across the vault, connected notes via wikilinks, and recent activity.

**Vault structure overview:**

```bash
engraph context vault-map
```

Returns folder counts, top tags, recent files — gives an AI agent orientation before it starts searching.

**Create a note via the write pipeline:**

```bash
engraph write create --content "# Meeting Notes\n\nDiscussed auth timeline with Sarah." --tags meeting,auth
```

engraph resolves tags against the registry (fuzzy matching), discovers potential wikilinks (`[[Sarah Chen]]`), suggests the best folder based on semantic similarity to existing notes, and writes atomically.

**Edit a specific section:**

```bash
engraph write edit --file "Meeting Notes" --heading "Action Items" --mode append --content "- [ ] Follow up with Sarah"
```

Targets the "Action Items" section by heading, appends content without touching the rest of the note.

**Rewrite a note (preserves frontmatter):**

```bash
engraph write rewrite --file "Meeting Notes" --content "# Meeting Notes\n\nRevised content here."
```

Replaces the entire body while keeping existing frontmatter (tags, dates, metadata) intact.

**Edit frontmatter:**

```bash
engraph write edit-frontmatter --file "Meeting Notes" --op add_tag --value "actionable"
```

Granular frontmatter mutations: `set`, `remove`, `add_tag`, `remove_tag`, `add_alias`, `remove_alias`.

**Delete a note:**

```bash
engraph write delete --file "Old Draft" --mode soft   # moves to archive
engraph write delete --file "Old Draft" --mode hard   # permanent removal
```

**Check vault health:**

```bash
engraph context health
```

Returns orphan notes (no links in or out), broken wikilinks, stale notes, and tag hygiene issues.

## HTTP REST API

`engraph serve --http` adds a full REST API alongside the MCP server, exposing the same capabilities over HTTP for web agents, scripts, and integrations.

**26 endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Permission | Description |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health-check` | read | Server health check |
| POST | `/api/search` | read | Hybrid search (semantic + FTS5 + graph + reranker + temporal) |

| POST | `/api/update-metadata` | write | Update note metadata |
| POST | `/api/delete` | write | Delete note (soft or hard) |
| GET | `/api/identity` | read | User identity (L0) and current context (L1) |
| POST | `/api/setup` | write | First-time onboarding setup (detect/apply modes) |
| POST | `/api/reindex-file` | write | Re-index a single file after external edits |
| POST | `/api/migrate/preview` | write | Preview PARA migration (classify + suggest moves) |
| POST | `/api/migrate/apply` | write | Apply PARA migration (move files) |
| POST | `/api/migrate/undo` | write | Undo last PARA migration |

**Authentication:**

All requests require an API key via the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_abc123..." http://localhost:3000/api/vault-map
```

Keys have either `read` or `write` permission. Write keys can access all endpoints; read keys are restricted to read-only endpoints. Use `--no-auth` for local development without keys (127.0.0.1 only).

**curl examples:**

```bash
# Search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "authentication architecture", "top_n": 5}'

# Read a note
curl http://localhost:3000/api/read/01-Projects/API-Design.md \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_..."

# Create a note
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "# Meeting Notes\n\nDiscussed auth timeline.", "tags": ["meeting", "auth"]}'
```

**Rate limiting:** Configurable per-key token bucket (requests per minute). Defaults to 60 req/min. Returns `429 Too Many Requests` when exceeded.

**CORS:** Configurable allowed origins in `config.toml` under `[http]`. Defaults to allow all origins for local development.

```toml
[http]
port = 3000
host = "127.0.0.1"
cors_origins = ["http://localhost:3000", "https://myapp.example.com"]
rate_limit = 60

[[http.api_keys]]
key = "eg_..."
permission = "write"
```

## PARA Migration

`engraph migrate para` restructures your vault into the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) using heuristic classification. The workflow is non-destructive: preview first, review the plan, then apply.

**Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Preview — classify notes and generate a migration plan
engraph migrate para --preview
# Outputs: markdown summary + JSON plan saved to ~/.engraph/

# 2. Review the plan (edit if needed)
cat ~/.engraph/migration_preview.md

# 3. Apply — move files according to the plan
engraph migrate para --apply

# 4. Undo — reverse the last migration if something looks wrong
engraph migrate para --undo
```

**Classification signals:**

| Category | Detection signals |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Projects** | Open tasks (`- [ ]`), active/in-progress status in frontmatter, project tags |
| **Areas** | Recurring topic keywords (health, finance, career, learning), area-related tags |
| **Resources** | People notes (People folder, person-like content), reference material, articles, code snippets |
| **Archive** | Done/completed/inactive status, no incoming or outgoing wikilinks, stale content |

Notes that don't match any signal with sufficient confidence stay in place. Daily notes (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) and templates are always skipped.

**MCP tools:** `migrate_preview`, `migrate_apply`, `migrate_undo` — available in `engraph serve` for AI-assisted migration.

**HTTP endpoints:** `POST /api/migrate/preview`, `/api/migrate/apply`, `/api/migrate/undo` — available via `engraph serve --http`.

## ChatGPT Actions

Connect your Obsidian vault to ChatGPT as a custom GPT Action. ChatGPT can search, read, create, and edit your notes through engraph's REST API.

### Prerequisites

- engraph installed and indexed (`engraph index ~/your-vault`)
- A tunnel tool: [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/) (recommended) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

### Step 1: Configure engraph

```bash
# Interactive setup — enables HTTP, creates API key, sets CORS
engraph configure --setup-chatgpt
```

Or configure manually in `~/.engraph/config.toml`:

```toml
[http]
enabled = true
port = 3000
host = "127.0.0.1"
rate_limit = 60
cors_origins = ["https://chat.openai.com", "https://chatgpt.com"]

[[http.api_keys]]
key = "eg_your_key_here"    # generate with: engraph configure --add-api-key --key-name chatgpt --key-permissions write
name = "chatgpt"
permissions = "write"        # "read" for search-only, "write" to also create/edit notes

[http.plugin]
name = "My Vault"
description = "Search and manage my Obsidian vault"
public_url = "https://your-tunnel-url.trycloudflare.com"   # set after starting tunnel
```

### Step 2: Start engraph + tunnel

**Terminal 1 — engraph HTTP server:**
```bash
engraph serve --http
```

**Terminal 2 — Cloudflare tunnel:**
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
# Prints a URL like: https://abc-xyz.trycloudflare.com
```

Or with ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
# Prints a URL like: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

### Step 3: Update config with tunnel URL

Edit `~/.engraph/config.toml` and set `public_url` to your tunnel URL:

```toml
[http.plugin]
public_url = "https://abc-xyz.trycloudflare.com"
```

Then restart engraph (`Ctrl+C` and re-run `engraph serve --http`). This ensures the OpenAPI spec points to the correct public URL.

### Step 4: Verify endpoints

```bash
# Both should return JSON (no auth required)
curl https://your-tunnel-url/openapi.json
curl https://your-tunnel-url/.well-known/ai-plugin.json

# Search with auth
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test search"}' \
  https://your-tunnel-url/api/search
```

### Step 5: Register in ChatGPT

1. Go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) → **Explore GPTs** → **Create**
2. Give your GPT a name (e.g., "Vault Assistant")
3. Add these **Instructions**:

```
You are a knowledge assistant connected to the user's Obsidian vault via engraph.

WORKFLOW:
1. Use searchVault to find relevant notes before answering questions
2. Use readNote for full content, readSection for specific headings
3. Use getWho for people context, getProject for project context
4. Use getVaultMap to orient yourself in the vault structure
5. Only create or edit notes when explicitly asked

SEARCH TIPS:
- Temporal queries ("last week", "yesterday") activate time-aware search automatically
- Results include confidence % — prefer higher confidence matches
- Fuzzy matching works: typos in names are handled

STYLE:
- Reference vault notes by name when answering
- Quote relevant snippets
- If information isn't in the vault, say so clearly
- Be concise
```

4. Click **Add Action** → **Import from URL**
5. Enter: `https://your-tunnel-url/openapi.json`
6. Click the **gear icon** next to Authentication
7. Select **API Key**, Auth Type: **Bearer**
8. Paste your API key (the `eg_...` key from Step 1)
9. **Save** and test

### Conversation starters

- "What happened in my vault last week?"
- "Summarize my current work projects"
- "Find notes related to [topic]"
- "Create a note about today's meeting with [person]"

### Notes

- **Tunnel URLs are temporary** (Cloudflare quick tunnels change on restart). For persistent URLs, set up a [named Cloudflare tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/) or use ngrok with a reserved domain.
- **Read-only mode**: set `permissions = "read"` on the API key if you don't want ChatGPT to create or modify notes.
- **Rate limiting**: default is 60 requests/minute per key. Adjust `rate_limit` in config if needed.
- **engraph must be running** on your machine for ChatGPT to access it. If you close the terminal, the connection drops.

## Use cases

**AI-assisted knowledge work** — Give Claude or Cursor deep access to your personal knowledge base. Instead of copy-pasting context, the agent searches, reads, and cross-references your notes directly.

**Developer second brain** — Index architecture docs, decision records, meeting notes, and code snippets. Search by concept across all of them.

**Research and writing** — Find connections between notes that you didn't explicitly link. The graph lane surfaces related content through shared wikilinks and mentions.

**Team knowledge graphs** — Index a shared docs vault. AI agents can answer "who knows about X?" and "what decisions were made about Y?" by traversing the note graph.

## How it compares

| | engraph | Basic RAG (vector-only) | Obsidian search |
|---|---|---|---|
| Search method | 5-lane RRF (semantic + BM25 + graph + reranker + temporal) | Vector similarity only | Keyword only |
| Query understanding | LLM orchestrator classifies intent, adapts weights | None | None |
| Understands note links | Yes (wikilink graph traversal) | No | Limited (backlinks panel) |
| AI agent access | MCP server (25 tools) + HTTP REST API (26 endpoints) | Custom API needed | No |
| Write capability | Create/edit/rewrite/delete with smart filing | No | Manual |
| Vault health | Orphans, broken links, stale notes, tag hygiene | No | Limited |
| Real-time sync | File watcher, 2s debounce | Manual re-index | N/A |
| Runs locally | Yes, llama.cpp + Metal GPU | Depends | Yes |
| Setup | One binary, one command | Framework + code | Built-in |

engraph is not a replacement for Obsidian — it's the intelligence layer that sits between your vault and your AI tools.

## Current capabilities

- 5-lane hybrid search (semantic + FTS5 + graph + cross-encoder reranker + temporal) with two-pass RRF fusion
- Temporal search: natural language date queries ("last week", "March 2026", "recent"), date extraction from frontmatter and filenames, smooth decay scoring
- Confidence % display: search results show normalized 0-100% confidence instead of raw RRF scores
- LLM research orchestrator: query intent classification + query expansion + adaptive lane weights
- llama.cpp inference via Rust bindings (GGUF models, Metal GPU on macOS, CUDA on Linux)
- Intelligence opt-in: heuristic fallback when disabled, LLM-powered when enabled
- MCP server with 25 tools (8 read, 10 write, 2 identity, 1 index, 1 diagnostic, 3 migrate) via stdio
- HTTP REST API with 26 endpoints, API key auth (`eg_` prefix), rate limiting, CORS — enabled via `engraph serve --http`
- User identity with L0/L1 tiered context for AI agent session starts
- Section-level reading and editing: target specific headings with replace/prepend/append modes
- Full note rewriting with automatic frontmatter preservation
- Granular frontmatter mutations: set/remove fields, add/remove tags and aliases
- Soft delete (archive) and hard delete (permanent) with audit logging
- Vault health diagnostics: orphan notes, broken wikilinks, stale content, tag hygiene
- Obsidian CLI integration with circuit breaker (Closed/Degraded/Open) for resilient delegation
- Real-time file watching with 2s debounce, startup reconciliation, and watcher coordination to prevent double re-indexing
- Write pipeline: tag resolution, fuzzy link discovery, semantic folder placement
- Context engine: topic bundles, person bundles, project bundles with token budgets
- Vault graph: bidirectional wikilink + mention edges with multi-hop expansion
- Placement correction learning from user file moves
- Enhanced file resolution with fuzzy Levenshtein matching fallback
- Content-based folder role detection (people, daily, archive) by content patterns
- PARA migration: AI-assisted vault restructuring into Projects/Areas/Resources/Archive with preview, apply, and undo workflow
- Configurable model overrides for multilingual support
- 426 unit tests, CI on macOS + Ubuntu

## Configuration

Optional config at `~/.engraph/config.toml`:

```toml
vault_path = "~/Documents/MyVault"
top_n = 10
exclude = [".obsidian/", "node_modules/", ".git/"]

# Enable LLM-powered intelligence (query expansion + reranking)
intelligence = true

# Override models for multilingual or custom use
[models]
# embed = "hf:Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF/qwen3-embedding-0.6b-q8_0.gguf"
# rerank = "hf:ggml-org/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-Q8_0-GGUF/qwen3-reranker-0.6b-q8_0.gguf"

# Obsidian CLI integration (auto-detected during init)
[obsidian]
# enabled = true
# cli_path = "/usr/local/bin/obsidian"

# Registered AI agents
[agents]
# names = ["claude-code", "cursor"]
```

All data stored in `~/.engraph/` — single SQLite database (~10MB typical), GGUF models, and vault profile.

## Development

See [Development and verification](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-and-verification) for build prerequisites, a safe CLI smoke check, focused tests, and the full local check suite. The current search regression fixture uses a mock model and does not download GGUF files.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss what you'd like to change.

The codebase is 26 Rust modules behind a lib crate. `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root has detailed architecture documentation for AI-assisted development.
